What is the primary differences in the way these two scripts work?

## Phind Says
The primary difference between the two scripts lies in the way they handle the Vortex procedure:

In the vortex_standard script, the Vortex procedure is performed using a fixed set of rules from the _rulesets/rules.txt file. The script reads the file and then executes the commands in a predefined order (rows 1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5, and 1 again). The order of the rules does not change in this script.
In the create_rulesets and adaptation_vortex script, the Vortex procedure is performed using a set of rules that are generated on-the-fly by permutating the original rules from the _rulesets/rules.txt file. The script creates 9 different rulesets by shifting the order of the rules and then selects one of them based on the value in _rulesets/choice/value.txt. The selected ruleset is then used to perform the Vortex procedure, and the order of the executed rules may change each time the script is run, depending on the chosen ruleset.
In summary, the vortex_standard script uses a fixed set of rules to perform the Vortex procedure, while the create_rulesets and adaptation_vortex script generates and selects from multiple rulesets to perform the Vortex procedure with more variation.

## My Prompt
What differentiates the permutated Vortex ruleset from one that uses random variations of rulesets to perform?

## Phind Says
In the given context, a permutated Vortex ruleset is generated by shifting the order of the original rules from the _rulesets/rules.txt file, creating a limited number of predefined permutations (9 in this case). The selection of the ruleset for each run is based on the value in _rulesets/choice/value.txt, which is incremented after each run. This approach provides variation in the Vortex procedure but is limited to the predefined permutations.

On the other hand, a Vortex ruleset that uses random variations would involve generating a ruleset by randomly selecting and ordering the rules from the original _rulesets/rules.txt file for each run. This method can produce a much larger number of possible combinations, resulting in a more unpredictable and diverse set of Vortex procedures.

The key difference between the two approaches is the level of variation and predictability in the Vortex procedures:

Permutated Vortex rulesets provide a limited and predefined set of variations. Once all permutations have been used, the process will start repeating the same variations.
Random Vortex rulesets offer a much larger number of possible combinations, making the Vortex procedure less predictable and more diverse.

## My Prompt
What are the advantages and disadvantages for each approach, and is there a way to combine the best of both worlds?

## Phind Says
The advantages and disadvantages of using permutated Vortex rulesets and random Vortex rulesets are as follows:

**Permutated Vortex rulesets:**

Advantages:
- Predictable and controlled variations: The predefined permutations provide a known set of variations, making it easier to anticipate the outcome of the Vortex procedure.
- Easier to debug: Since the variations are limited and predefined, it is easier to trace and fix any issues that may arise during the Vortex procedure.

Disadvantages:
- Limited variations: The number of possible permutations is finite, which may result in less diversity in the Vortex procedures.
- Repetitive: Once all permutations are used, the process will start repeating the same variations, potentially reducing the effectiveness of the Vortex procedure.

**Random Vortex rulesets:**

Advantages:
- High diversity: Randomly selecting and ordering the rules can produce a large number of possible combinations, resulting in a more diverse set of Vortex procedures.
- Less predictable: The Vortex procedure becomes less predictable, which can be useful in certain applications where unpredictability is desired.

Disadvantages:
- Harder to debug: Since the variations are randomly generated, it can be more challenging to trace and fix any issues that may arise during the Vortex procedure.
- Potentially less control: Randomly generating rulesets may lead to less control over the Vortex procedure, which may not be suitable for all applications.

To combine the best of both worlds, you can implement a hybrid approach that uses both permutated and random Vortex rulesets. One way to do this is by using a predefined set of permutations as a starting point and then randomly selecting a subset of those permutations for each run. This approach allows you to maintain some level of predictability and control while still introducing randomness and increased diversity in the Vortex procedure.

Here's a simple example of how you might implement this hybrid approach:

```ruby
def hybrid_vortex
  # Generate the permutated rulesets as before
  create_rulesets

  # Read all the permutated rulesets
  all_rulesets = [
    File.readlines("_adaptation/ruleset_shift1.txt"),
    File.readlines("_adaptation/ruleset_shift2.txt"),
    File.readlines("_adaptation/ruleset_shift3.txt"),
    File.readlines("_adaptation/ruleset_shift4.txt"),
    File.readlines("_adaptation/ruleset_shift5.txt"),
    File.readlines("_adaptation/ruleset_shift6.txt"),
    File.readlines("_adaptation/ruleset_shift7.txt"),
    File.readlines("_adaptation/ruleset_shift8.txt"),
    File.readlines("_adaptation/ruleset_shift9.txt"),
  ]

  # Randomly select a subset of the permutated rulesets
  selected_rulesets = all_rulesets.sample(5)

  # Randomly select one ruleset from the subset
  chosen_ruleset = selected_rulesets.sample

  # Perform the Vortex procedure using the chosen ruleset
  # ...
end
```

This hybrid approach provides a balance between the predictability and control of permutated rulesets and the diversity and randomness of random rulesets.
