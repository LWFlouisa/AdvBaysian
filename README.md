Evaluation of different datasets based on randomized rulesets.

## Definition Of Vortex Procedures
Note that mode here is borrowed from music theory, where a mode is the same music scale with a different tonic key.

~~~
Vortex Standard - This switches rows in the known ruleset based on modular arithmetic.
Shuffled Vortex - This procedure uses the shuffled ruleset which is always random.
Adaptive Vortex - Not yet implemented. Vortex procedure based on a "mode" of the known ruleset that isn't random.
~~~

## Use Cases
For non machine learning, the best use case is in using the terminal to play predefined music tones.
